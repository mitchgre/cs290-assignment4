login.php should have a form where a user can enter a username. It
should have a button that says "Login". 

Upon clicking the login button the page should POST the username to
the page content1.php. The username should be posted via a parameter
called username. If the username is an empty string or null,
content1.php should display the message "A username must be
entered. Click here to return to the login screen.". The text 'here'
should be a link that links back to login.php. If the username is any
other string it should display the text "Hello [username] you have
visited this page [n] times before. Click here to logout.". n should
display 0 on the first visit, 1 on the 2nd and so on. The text 'here'
should log the user out, destroying the session, and return them to
the login screen.  

If the user navigates away from the page and returns, the session
should persist. The user may not navigate back via a POST. This is OK,
the count should persist. The POST is only needed for the initial
login. 

If a user tries to access either content1.php or content2.php without
going through the login page at some previous point in time the user
should should simply be redirected back to login.php. There are
different ways to accomplish this. One might be to set a variable when
a session is started the 'correct' way and check if that variable
exists when loading the page. 

content1.php must have a link to content2.php that is displayed only
after a user has logged in (this includes subsequent visits not from
login.php). content2.php should have a link back to content1.php. Both
content1.php and content2.php should require that a user at some point
logged in to access them. Otherwise they should redirect back to
login.php.
